					<p>
						Musician and web developer born in 1991 in Belgrade, currently
						living in <span>UÅ¾ice</span>, Serbia. I come from a musical family.
						I play keyboard and accordion, and I also teach people how to play
						accordion. I love animals.{' '}
					</p>
					<p>
						I design and create web apps. I have one year of formal work
						experience, working as a <span>front-end developer</span> in a
						company called Boca Tech in Belgrade, although my assignments also
						included UI/UX design (mock-ups, prototyping), data-entry and other.
						I also do freelancing as a developer and UI/UX designer, so overall
						I have over 2 years of experience.
					</p>
					<p>
						My main tech stack is JavaScript. For client side, that would be{' '}
						<span>React</span>, and for back-end, <span>Node.js</span>{' '}
						(Express.js), and I am also familiar with <span>SQL</span>{' '}
						(PostgreSQL) and <span>MongoDB</span>. My plan is to expand my
						skills with new tools and frameworks such as Svelte.js, GraphQL and
						other.
					</p>
					<p>
						I accept new <span>clients</span> but I would also be interested in
						a great full-time <span>job</span> with awesome colleagues!
